#summary Information about polygons.

Polygons are objects which have a shape defined by points. Although polygons are supposedly used to creating a irregular shape that the ball collides with. They are often used to display foreground images or link movement objects and teleports together. [Circles] can be used to do these functions as well.

== Foreground Images ==
To create a moving image, polygons can be used with the collision property set to false and movement info applied to them. Sometimes when emitters are placed on levels, they emit particles over the background. Polygons are used to place a foreground image that mimics the background over the top so that particles have a more 3D perspective.
